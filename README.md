# Donut-Clicker

## Overview
- A simple clicker game created using PyGame, an open-source Python library. This project was created in 2021 as my final project for my "Introduction to Computer Science" course.
- The purpose of this game is very simple, you press the spacebar until you don't feel like it anymore. Pressing the spacebar will generate points in which you can purchase upgrades that will increase the amount of points you get per click.
